Run this project with ./launch-dev.sh. It will install all dependencies for you 
and launch two websites: the firebase database and the actual signup page. If 
it doesn't connect at first, just refresh the page, sometimes Firebase is a tad
slow. The website addresses are in the terminal output if it doesn't open them
automatically.

I don't really know why, but it sometimes has trouble running outside of VS Code.
I recommend setting it up within VS Code if possible- it might be a dependencies
tihng.
